# React is just Javascript!

## Building a Layout
In this exercise we will build a layout. This will comprise several steps:

1. Build an Avatar component, using *Composition* to create a complex component.
2. Break up the existing App.js into individual components
3. Add a footer and a menu

We'll work through these together. The completed solution is in `reddit-project-frontend-04`.

If we get through this before the end of the session, we will move on to the component lifecycle and state.
